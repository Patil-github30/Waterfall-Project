# Waterfall Model-
•	Waterfall model is useful in the situation where the project requirements are well defined and the project goals are clear.
•	Waterfall model follows sequential approach.
•	In this model each phase is completed entirely and then only moved to the next phase.
•	Waterfall model relies on documentation to ensure that the project is well defined and project team is working toward clear goals.
•	Ones that particular phase has been completed and ones we move to the next phase , we cannot go back to the previous phase to make changes. 
•	This model is stable for the projects when the requirements are clear.
•	Phases of waterfall model-

Requirements Gathering- In this phase, all the requirements are gathered from the stakeholder.
These requirements are analysed to understand the scope of the project.

Design- After the requirements are cleared, Design phase starts.
This has a detailed design document that outlines the software architecture, user interface, and system components.

Development- The Development phase include implementation. 
It involves coding the software based on the design specifications. 

Testing- In the testing phase, the software is tested as a whole to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free from defects.

Deployment- Once the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment.

Maintenance- This is the final stage of waterfall model.
It involves fixing any issues that arise after the software has been deployed and ensuring that it continues to meet the requirements over time. 


# Waterfall-Project

**Project Overview**
The Food Ordering System project follows the Waterfall model, focusing on providing a structured approach to managing requirements and ensuring clear communication throughout the development process. This documentation is designed to serve as a reference for the various stages of the project, detailing business analysis strategies, stakeholder interactions, and requirements management.

**Contents**

1. **Business Context Diagram (BCD)**
Provides a high-level view of the business processes and their interactions with internal and external entities.

2. **RACI Chart**
Defines roles and responsibilities for team members and stakeholders using the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix.

3. **Business Analysis Strategy**
This section includes:

Identify the Stakeholders: Categorizes stakeholders and defines their roles in the project.
Elicitation Techniques: Lists the techniques used for gathering requirements (e.g., Interviews, Workshops, Surveys).
Handling Change Requests: Explains the process for managing and evaluating change requests throughout the project lifecycle.
Sign-off on UAT: Describes the Client Project Acceptance Form used to confirm successful User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
Project Progress Updates: Outlines the methods for reporting progress to stakeholders (status reports, meetings).
Communication Channels: Specifies the communication mediums (emails, meetings, status calls) and frequency.
Client Approvals: Details the process for obtaining approvals at various stages of the project.

4. **Functional Specifications**
Functional Requirement Specification (FRS): Captures the functional requirements of the system, defining what the application will do.

6. **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
Maps each business requirement to the corresponding functional requirements, ensuring that all requirements are addressed in the final product.

7. **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
The BRD outlines the high-level business needs and includes:

  Document Revision History
  Approvals Section
  RACI Chart
  Introduction:
    Business Goals
    Business Objectives
    Business Rules
    Background Information
    Project Objectives
  Project Scope:
    In-Scope Functionality
    Out-of-Scope Functionality
Assumptions 
Constraints
Risk Analysis
Business Process Overview (AS-IS): Describes the current process and areas of improvement.
Proposed System (TO-BE): Illustrates the future state of the system after implementation.

7. **Business Requirements**
Details the specific business requirements and their alignment with the project’s overall objectives.
A table that has Requirement ID,	Requirement Name,	Requirement Description,	Priority

**Project Management Methodology:**
Waterfall Model
The project uses the Waterfall methodology, which divides the work into distinct phases: Requirements Gathering, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

**Requirements Documentation:** BRD, FRS, and RTM.

**Activity Diagram**
Represents the flow of activities and interactions for various business processes within the system. Includes swimlanes to depict the roles of different actors.

**Screens and Pages**
This section provides mockups and wireframes of the system's UI, depicting the navigation flow and layout of screens such as:

**Elicitation Techniques:** 
Interviews:- Conduct interview with the stakeholders like restaurant owners, chefs, delivery people in order to get their expectations, needs, preferences and also issues related to the application.
Brainstorming:- Conduct brainstorming sessions in order to get the functional requirements. Also brainstorm on the problematic areas in order to get a desired solution.
Prototype:- Create the prototypes of the food ordering system to demonstrate the functionality to the stakeholders. Also make prototypes to demonstrate the user interface of the stakeholders. Also show them navigation from one page to other.
Questionnaire:- Prepare a set of questions in order to get the feedback on food ordering habits, preferred features or the challenges faced on daily basis.
Observation:- To observe the current process of food ordering system. This will help to know how the actual process is running, also it will help to identify the issues with the current system, helps to understand the interactions.
Workshops
Surveys

Change Management: Formal Change Request Process.
Approval Management: UAT Sign-off, Client Acceptance Forms.
Conclusion
The Food Ordering System project adheres to the Waterfall model to ensure that each phase is completed sequentially, with a focus on thorough documentation and stakeholder engagement at each step.
